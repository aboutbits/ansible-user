        name: ansible-user
      vars:
        user_name: alex
        user_password: sha512-hashed-password
        user_groups:

```

```

```bash
git tag v2
git push --tags
```

Replacing an already existing minor release:

```bash
git tag -d v2
git push origin :refs/tags/v2
git tag v2
git push --tags
```
